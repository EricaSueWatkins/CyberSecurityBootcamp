# Cloud Network

This is a collection Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp class.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 2 servers running DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server funning an ELK stack container.
